# 2022-pizza

The 2022 proto bot code, called pizza because it just has the chassis and drivetrain, not any of the other subsystems.

This repo is for drive team practice, testing our auto framework, and helping new team members learn how to do things (like push code, merge branches and comment code).

Demonstrates best practices for Outliers team programming:
- docs folder
- JavaDoc comments
- config folder
- many classes refactored for clarity
- state machines

Has mock classes for subsystems that aren't implemented in hardware on pizza bot:
- intake
- indexer
- catapult

FRC Rapid React game

See the docs folder for the season plan, design and specifications.
