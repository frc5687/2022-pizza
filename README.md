# 2022-pizza
The 2022 proto bot code.  We're calling it pizza bot because it's not actually a proto bot.  Just has the drivetrain, not any of the other subsystems. To be used primarily for drive team practice, testing our auto framework, and helping new team members learn how to do things (like push code).
