/**
 * ButtonMap is used to abstract button and controller mapping out of the OI class, and make it easier to
 * change button assignment without breaking the OI code.
 * 
 * The class is broken into three parts:
 * * The Controllers class holds the port assignments for each controller.  Note that if a controller is to be unplugged
 *   you should set the port to -1.  For the most part this will cause OI to ignore it.
 * 
 * * The Axes class has a subclass for each axis (or group of axes) in use.  Each axis subclass should have a constant defining
 *   which controller it's mapped to and a constant for each axis in the group.
 * 
 * * The Buttons class has a subclass for each button in use.  Each button subclass should have a constant defining
 *   which controller it's mapped to and a constant for the button number itself.
